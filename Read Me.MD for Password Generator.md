Title: Password Generator

Project Description: I was tasked with creating random password that would meet particular criterias.

I created arrays for the password criterias and functions to pull information from this array to meet password criterias.

The Password criterias used for the password prompts are lenght of characters, Uppercase, Lowercase and Symbols.

Upon viewing the password prompts in the browser, I saw the 4 prompts that asked the password criteria and whether password should include an Uppercase, Numbers, Lowercase letters and symbols. 

Upon answering those questions, I was able to see the randomly generated letters, numbers and symbols.

I've included snapshot of what I saw after hitting on the "Generate Password" on the browser.
